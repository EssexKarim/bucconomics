Welcome! We're thrilled that you'd like to help build BUCCONOMICS ‚Äî an open-source infrastructure to empower local communities with decentralized financial tools.

This document outlines our collaboration standards, development approach, and contribution process, rooted in Agile, Test-Driven Development (TDD), Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), and Agile Product Management.




# üö¶ Code of Conduct

We‚Äôre committed to creating a respectful, inclusive, and safe environment for everyone.

Be kind and constructive.

Assume positive intent.

Debate ideas, not people.

Avoid discriminatory or offensive behavior.

See our Code of Conduct for full details.




# üöÄ How to Contribute

1. Propose Ideas or Report Issues

Open a GitHub Issue with a clear problem statement, feature request, or improvement idea.

Use the labels bug, enhancement, or help wanted appropriately.


2. Discuss or Refine via Discussions

Use Discussions to collaborate on design, product feedback, or strategic suggestions before coding begins.


3. Fork & Create a Feature Branch

# Clone your fork locally
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bucconomics.git
$ git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name


4. Write Behavior Specs (BDD)

Use Gherkin syntax to define the behavior before coding:

Feature: Token staking
  Scenario: User stakes BUCC tokens
    Given the user has BUCC tokens
    When the user stakes tokens into a pool
    Then the dashboard shows yield projection


5. Write Tests (TDD)

Begin with failing unit/integration tests. Commit tests before implementation. Then make them pass.


6. Submit a Pull Request

Push your branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request

Reference the related issue in your PR description (e.g., Closes #21)

Ensure tests pass and follow our coding guidelines (below)

A team member will review your submission and may request changes before merging.

# üíª Coding Guidelines

Use meaningful names and clear logic.

Prefer composition over inheritance.

Adhere to code linting/formatting rules (TBD via .prettierrc or .eslintrc).

Write readable, well-commented code.

Use docstrings or JSdoc as needed.

If you're not sure about style, check other files in the repo or ask in a discussion!




# ‚úÖ Testing & Validation

Follow TDD: write failing tests before implementing features.

Aim for high coverage of critical paths (e.g., lending, governance logic).

Use tools like Jest, Hardhat, or Truffle (depending on repo modules).

Run tests locally:

npm install
npm test

We welcome tests for edge cases, smart contract security, and regression prevention.




# üîÑ Agile & Iterative Delivery

We work in short iterations. If your contribution is part of a larger feature:

Break it down into smaller, testable parts.

Submit MVPs or working slices.

Add your work to the /projects Kanban board if relevant.





# üôå Thank You

Whether you're fixing a typo, designing governance flows, or writing Solidity ‚Äî your contribution matters. We're building this for everyone, with everyone.
