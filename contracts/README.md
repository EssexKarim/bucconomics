# 🛠️ Smart Contracts

This folder will contain all blockchain-based smart contracts that power BUCCONOMICS. These include contracts for:

- Savings and reconsolidation loan mechanisms
- Governance token logic
- DAO voting (including quadratic voting)
- Liquidity and staking pools
- Community fund redistribution

# Coming Soon
Initial contracts will be written in Solidity and designed for Ethereum-compatible chains (e.g. Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism).

# Standards
- ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 (where applicable)
- Quadratic voting integration
- Compatible with Compound, AAVE, and Uniswap

> Contributors: Please write tests for all new contracts and follow TDD guidelines.
